## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### EyeVision – AI-Powered Violence Detection System for Daycares

EyeVision is an AI-powered system that uses advanced computer vision and video analytics to automatically detect signs of violence in daycares from regular CCTV footage. Leveraging deep learning models for both visual and motion analysis, our solution achieved over 90% accuracy in real-time detection and alerting through a dedicated app for parents and authorities. Beyond its technical innovation, EyeVision presents a scalable business solution with strong social impact potential — and was awarded First Place in the College of Management’s Outstanding Final Project Competition.
